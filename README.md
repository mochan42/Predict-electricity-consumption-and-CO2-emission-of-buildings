# Predict-electricity-consumption-and-CO2-emission-of-buildings

# Aim of this project

* The aim of this project was to create predict the electricity consumption and the C02 emissions of buildings : this is a regression problem.<br>
* After clearning up the date, several machine learning models were used to perform regression : <br>
linear models : linear regression, using Ridge and Lasso regularization, <br>
non linear : Support Vector Machines, <br>
and decision tree models : Random Forest, XGBoost, GradientBoostingRegressor <br>
